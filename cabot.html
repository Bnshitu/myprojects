                      <strong><i>John Cabot (1450?-1499), </i></strong> 
                       Italian navigator and explorer, who attempted to find a direct route to Asia. 
                       Although Cabot was probably born in Genoa, as a youth he moved to Venice, where
                       his seafaring career probably began. He became a naturalized Venetian in 1476, 
                       but about eight years later settled in Bristol, England. Cabot had developed 
                       a theory that Asia might be reached by sailing westward. This theory appealed
                       to several wealthy merchants of Bristol, who agreed to give him financial support.
                       In 1493, when reports reached England that Christopher Columbus had made 
                       the westward passage to Asia, Cabot and his supporters began to make plans 
                       for a more direct crossing to the Orient. The proposed expedition was authorized
                       on March 5, 1496, by King Henry VII of England. 
                       
                       With a crew of 18 men, Cabot sailed from Bristol on May 2, 1497, on the Matthew. 
                       He steered a generally northwestward course, and on June 24, after a rough voyage,
                       he landed, perhaps on present-day Cape Breton Island; he subsequently sailed 
                       along the Labrador, Newfoundland, and New England coasts.

                        claimed the region for Henry VII.
                       </i></strong> 
                        Cabot returned to England in August and was granted a pension. 
                        Assured of royal support, he immediately planned a second exploratory voyage 
                        that he hoped would bring him to Cipangu (Japan). The expedition, consisting 
                        of four or five ships and 300 men, left Bristol in May 1498. The fate of this
                        expedition is uncertain. It is believed that in June, Cabot reached the eastern
                        coast of Greenland and sailed northward along the coast until his crews 
                        mutinied because of the severe cold and forced him to turn southward. 
                        He may have cruised along the coast of North America to Chesapeake Bay
                        at latitude 38Â° North. He was forced to return to England because of 
                        a lack of supplies, and he died soon afterward.
