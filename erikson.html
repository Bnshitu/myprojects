                      <strong><i> Leif Eriksson (975-1020), </i></strong> Icelandic explorer thought to
                       have been one of the first Europeans to set foot on North American soil. 
                       His name is also spelled Erikson, Ericsson, or Eiriksson. He was the second son 
                       of Erik the Red, who in about 985 established the first European settlement on 
                       Greenland after he was exiled from Iceland. Leif Erkisson’s story was recorded by 
                       several Icelandic writers in the 13th and 14th centuries, but the accounts which
                       they give differ so greatly that it is not possible to be certain of the 
                       details of Leif’s career.
                       <h2>Saga Of Eric The Red</h2>
                       According to the 13th-century Saga of Erik the Red, Leif, a sailor like his 
                       father, voyaged from Greenland to Norway, the homeland of his family, s
                       hortly before 1000. 
                       There, King Olaf I converted him to Christianity and later sent him back 
                       to Greenland to win its Viking settlers over to the Christian faith

                      <h2>Tale Of The GreenLanders</h2>
                      <strong>
                        <i> A different story is told in Tale of the Greenlanders,</i>
                     </strong> 
                          a saga that modern scholars believe is older and more reliable 
                           than the Saga of Erik the Red. According to Tale of the Greenlanders, 
                           an Icelandic trader named Bjarni Herjólfsson was the first European to sight
                           land in North America. Some years later, Leif bought Bjarni's ship and, 
                           based on his description, retraced the voyage shortly after 1000. 
                           As he sailed, he reached what he called Helluland (perhaps Baffin Island) 
                           and Markland (perhaps Labrador) before finding Vinland. 
                           Leif and his crew built shelters and stayed in Vinland for a year or two 
                           before returning to Greenland. Leif lent his ship to his brother Thorvald 
                           for further exploration of Vinland where, according to some sagas, 
                           Thorvald was killed by Native Americans.
                          <h2>Where is Vinland</h2>  
                           The precise identity of Vinland remains controversial among scholars. 
                           Some say it is Newfoundland, others, Nova Scotia or even New England. 
                           In 1963 archaeologists found ruins of a Viking-type settlement 
                           at L'Anse aux Meadows, in northern Newfoundland, which correspond
                           to Leif’s description of Vinland.
