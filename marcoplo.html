                      <strong><i> Marco Polo (1254-1324), </i></strong> Venetian traveler and author,
                       whose account of his travels and experiences in China offered Europeans 
                       a firsthand view of Asian lands and stimulated interest in Asian trade. 
                       Marco Polo was born in Venice, one of the most prominent centers of trade 
                       in medieval Europe, into a merchant family. Venetian merchants of the day 
                       traded regularly throughout the Mediterranean region. They also maintained 
                       trading posts in port cities on the Black Sea, where they obtained silk, 
                       porcelain, and other goods that came from China over the Silk Road, an ancient
                       trade route linking China with Rome. Little is known about Marco Polo’s 
                       early life, because his own account of his travels, published later in his
                       life, is the primary source of biographical material about him. 
                       Polo probably received a fairly typical education for children of 
                       merchants at that time, learning how to read, write, and calculate.
                       Marco Polo’s account is also the primary source of information about the
                       travels of his father and uncle, Niccolò and Maffeo Polo, who were jewel 
                       merchants. They left Venice in 1260 on a commercial venture to the Black 
                       Sea ports of Constantinople (now İstanbul, Turkey) and Soldaia (now Sudak, Ukraine).

                      <h2>Marco Polo's Accounts</h2>
                      <strong><i> Christopher Columbus is difficult without understanding the
                          world into which he was born.</i></strong> From Soldaia they continued farther
                          east to trading cities on the Volga River in present-day Russia. In 1262 a war 
                          broke out behind them and prevented them from returning home, so they proceeded
                          farther east to the great Central Asian trading city of Bukhara (in present-day
                          Uzbekistan). After three years there they joined a diplomatic mission going to 
                          the court of Kublai Khan, the Mongol ruler of China. The khan received them warmly
                          and expressed a desire to learn more about Christianity. He asked the Polo brothers
                          to return to Europe and persuade the pope to send Christian scholars who could
                          explain the religion to him. Niccolò and Maffeo journeyed back to Europe in 1269
                          to satisfy the khan’s request.The pope appointed two missionaries to accompany 
                          the Polos on their return to the Mongol court. The party set out in 1271, this
                          time with Niccolò’s son Marco. Soon after their departure from Acre 
                          (now ‘Akko, Israel) the missionaries became concerned about hazardous conditions 
                          along the route and abandoned the embassy. The three Polos continued the journey. 
                          Judging from Marco’s account, they most likely traveled overland through Armenia 
                          and Persia (now Iran) to Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, north through 
                          Persia to the Oxus River (now Amu Darya) in Central Asia, up the Oxus to the 
                          Pamirs, across the mountains and around the southern edge of the Takla Makan 
                          Desert to Lop Nur (in present-day Xinjiang Uygur (Uighur) Autonomous Region 
                          in western China), and across the Gobi Desert. In 1275 they reached the summer
                          court of Kublai Khan at Shangdu (about 300 km/about 200 mi north of present-day Beijing).
                           Marco’s account records that the khan warmly welcomed the party and arranged
                           accommodations for them.
