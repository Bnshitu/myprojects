                        <strong><i>Samuel de Champlain (1567?-1635),</i></strong> French explorer,
                         known as the father 
                        of New France, the French colonial empire in North America. 
                        He established a trading <br />
                        post, which eventually became the city of Qu√©bec,
                        in 1608 at the first narrows of the St. Lawrence River and governed
                        it until his death. <br />
                        <strong><i>Early Life</i></strong>
                        Champlain was born 
                        in Brouage, France, but little is
                        known of his early years. His parents may have been members of the lower
                        nobility. <br />
                        Like his father before him, he served as a naval captain. He 
                        thus acquired the training that made him a very competent navigator and
                        geographer, and an excellent cartographer.

                        <strong><i>John Cabot (1450?-1499),</i></strong> Italian navigator and explorer, 
                        who attempted to find a direct route to Asia. Although Cabot was probably born in Genoa,
                        <br />
                        as a youth he moved to Venice, where his seafaring 
                        career probably began. He became a naturalized Venetian in 1476, but about 
                        eight years later settled in Bristol, England. Cabot had developed a theory
                        that Asia might be reached by sailing westward. This theory appealed to
                        several wealthy merchants of Bristol,<br />
                        who agreed to give him financial 
                        support. In 1493, when reports reached England that Christopher Columbus
                        had made the westward passage to Asia, Cabot <br />
                        and his supporters began to make plans for a more direct crossing to the Orient. 
                        The proposed expedition was authorized on March 5, 1496, <br />
                        by King Henry VII of England.
