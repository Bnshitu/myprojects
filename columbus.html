                        <strong><i> Columbus (1451-1506),</i></strong> Italian-born Spanish navigator 
                        who sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean in search of a route to 
                        Asia but achieved fame by making landfall in the Americas instead.
                        On October 12, 1492, two worlds unknown to each other met for the 
                        first time on a small island in the Caribbean Sea. While on a voyage 
                        for Spain in search of a direct sea route from Europe to Asia, 
                        Christopher Columbus unintentionally encountered the Americas. 
                        However, in four separate voyages to the Caribbean from 1492 to 1504,
                        he remained convinced that he had found the lands that Marco Polo 
                        reached in his overland travels to China at the end of the 13th century.
                        To Columbus it was only a matter of time before a passage was found 
                        through the Caribbean islands to the fabled cities of Asia. 
                        Columbus was not the first European to reach the Americas—Vikings 
                        from Scandinavia had briefly settled on the North American coast, 
                        in what is now Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in the late 10th or 
                        early 11th century. However, Columbus’s explorations had a profound impact
                        on the world.

                        <h2>Europe In The Time Of Columbus</h2>
                        <strong><i> Christopher Columbus is difficult without understanding the
                            world into which he was born.</i></strong> The 15th century was a century of change, 
                        and many events that occurred during that time profoundly affected European
                        society. Many of these events were driven by the centuries-long conflict 
                        between Christians and Muslims, followers of the religion known as Islam.
                        The event that had the most far-reaching effects on Europe in the 15th 
                        century was the fall of the city of Constantinople (modern İstanbul, Turkey) 
                        to the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Constantinople had been the capital of the
                        Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire for centuries, and it was an important 
                        center for trade between Europe and Asia. In 1453 the Ottoman Empire, 
                        which had already conquered much of southeastern Europe, captured the city, 
                        closing an important trade route from Europe to the east (see Ottoman Empire). 
                        European merchants could still buy Asian goods from Muslims in places such 
                        as Alexandria, Egypt. However, Europeans longed for a sea route to Asia that
                        would allow them to bypass the Muslims and purchase Asian products directly.
                        In addition, European princes and kings quickly realized that the first 
                        nation to find such a route could become very wealthy by monopolizing the 
                        highly profitable Asian trade.
