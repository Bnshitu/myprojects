                      <strong><i>Samuel de Champlain (1567?-1635),</i></strong> 
                       French explorer, 
                       known as the father of New France, the French colonial empire in North America.
                       He established a trading post, which eventually became the city of Québec, 
                       in 1608 at the first narrows of the St. Lawrence River and governed it until his death.
                       <h2>Early Life</h2>
                       Champlain was born in Brouage, France, but little is known of his early years. 
                       His parents may have been members of the lower nobility. Like his father before him, 
                       he served as a naval captain. He thus acquired the training that made him a very 
                       competent navigator and geographer, and an excellent cartographer.

                      <h2>The First Visit To North America</h2>
                      <strong><i> In 1603 Champlain made his first visit to North America as a royal 
                        geographer on a fur trading expedition.
                       </i></strong> 
                        The expedition sailed to Tadoussac, at the mouth of the Saguenay River,
                        which had long been a trading center for the indigenous peoples living along the St.
                        Lawrence. Here the French were accustomed to meeting the Montagnais people bringing
                        furs to trade for French cloth and metal wares.

                        Champlain made good use of his time there. He ventured far up the Saguenay, 
                        up the St. Lawrence River to Montréal Island, and up the river that would be
                        named the Richelieu. He gathered information from the Montagnais on the 
                        geography of the northeastern section of the continent. He used this information 
                        to draw a remarkably accurate map showing a large bay to the north (Hudson Bay) 
                        and water to the west, which he later discovered was the Great Lakes. 
                        This western body of water was so large that he believed it must connect with
                        the Pacific Ocean, thus forming the fabled Northwest Passage through the continent.
                        Many 17th-century explorers were searching for that passage, believing it 
                        would provide an easy water route to the wealth of China.
